make a sessions button component, tell it to render certain things based on whether the person is logged in or not 

CSS:
  Maybe make the html component first then convert it to JSX
  Don't independently style everything 
  rails just requires everything that's in the stylesheets directory 


Handle different pages with routes in your App component 

MVP stuff 
  In the frontend folder, there is an MVP checklist for different projects 

Create an issue for each MVP 
  Have it be a PA review and the name of the issue


How to handle song index items 
  Maybe make it a song index item container 
  Maybe pass it down through the props


Payload Api routes 
  Jesse says definitely only hit it once 
  

Maybe have a blank album, artist in the state


Maybe have it so you click the annotation to see the comments 
Overflow scroll - I can limit the maximum height, then have a scroll bar pop up 
  (Maybe use this)

Just set the default values to the demo user's credentials
  Name: Demo User
  Password: password

Flex: 2, 1- (Can proportion the stuff properly) (For example, flex:2, flex:1 divides the flex children to take up 2/3 and 1/3 of the flexed 
respectively div)

How should I go about protecting my routes? Ummmm

I should protect actions intended for logged in users 

Should I re-factor? 
  Re-factor before you get into bonus features
  Re-factor embarrasing code 

Shouldn't have console errors 
  Console errors will cost me points

I can afford to go back and fix stuff 

Hope says comments will take a day, comments will take a day

Having the bulk of the site looking good is more important 

Make it so the annotation stuff can be closed easily 

Should have a button for demo instead of auto-populating 

There's an issue with the sign-in/sign out text on the forms 

Hope says I need a lot of tinkerng with styling 
  Try to get lyrics really well styled 

Do comments first 
Hope says to try and get it on the side
